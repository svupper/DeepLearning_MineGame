This is a mini Project consisting of creating an AI that can play the Mines game
The idea is to feed a Neural network with the revealed case and to make him learn from mistake how to
deal with the logic of the game
For exemple, if he reveals a "2" case, the network will try to reveal an other case
until he fails and find a bomb, the path of node revealed will be annalyse and retain, the longer it can
succeed in revealing cases the more he will be to retain the way he revealed it.
The algorithm doesn't try to solve the mine game by uderstanding how to play correctly but
how to find a new logic to win it.
This will therfor consisting of failling a lot, until it breaks a new logic to understand how to reveal it
and at last this new logic will be the same as the real way to play it.
I wanted by that to found an algorithm capable of playing any game, just by manipulating input and output
by rewarding survavibility of the model inside the game and avoiding "Death".
I'm aware that this behavior will lead to looping scenarios sometimes where the algorithm won't be able
to win nor to lose and I'm working on it to solve this issue.
